        <h1>Content & Education</h1>
        <p>I create educational content about AI, app development, and the future of creation. My goal is to make advanced technical skills accessible to everyone through practical, entertaining demos.</p>
        
        <p>Where to find me:</p>
        
        <p>• <a href="https://tiktok.com/@rileybrown.ai" class="link external">TikTok</a> - 617K followers, daily AI demos and tutorials<br>
        • <a href="https://instagram.com/rileybrown.ai" class="link external">Instagram</a> - Behind-the-scenes and longer form content<br>
        • <a href="https://youtube.com/@rileybrown" class="link external">YouTube</a> - In-depth tutorials and live coding sessions</p>
        
        <p>What I post:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Live app-building sessions (cloned an $80M app in 60 minutes)</li>
            <li>AI tool comparisons and tutorials</li>
            <li>Vibe coding techniques and workflows</li>
            <li>Real apps built without traditional programming</li>
            <li>Monetization strategies for AI-built products</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>My content philosophy: show, don't tell. Instead of explaining that AI can build apps, I live-stream the entire process. Instead of talking about what's possible, I build it in real-time.</p>
        
        <p>The response has been incredible. Millions of views, thousands of apps launched by viewers, and a community of creators who've discovered they can build more than they ever imagined.</p>

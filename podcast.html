        <h1>A New Vibe</h1>
        <p>A weekly podcast exploring how AI is transforming creation, business, and human potential. I talk with builders, creators, and thinkers about what's actually working right now.</p>
        
        <p>Each episode focuses on practical applications of AI that you can use today. No hype, no theoretical future-speak - just real tools and techniques from people building the future.</p>
        
        <p>Recent episodes:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The $12K/month transcription app built entirely with AI</li>
            <li>How non-developers are launching successful SaaS products</li>
            <li>The workflow behind cloning billion-dollar apps in hours</li>
            <li>Monetization strategies for AI-built products</li>
            <li>Building real businesses without traditional coding skills</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The podcast started as a way to document my own journey from content creator to product builder. What began as personal experiments turned into a movement of creators discovering they could build more than they ever thought possible.</p>
        
        <p>I release new episodes every Tuesday. Each one includes the exact prompts, tools, and workflows I used to build something real that week.</p>

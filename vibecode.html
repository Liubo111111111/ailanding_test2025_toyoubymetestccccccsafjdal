        <h1>VibeCode</h1>
        <p>The AI-powered mobile app builder that turns text prompts into fully functional iOS and Android apps in as little as 20 minutes.</p>
        
        <p>Co-founded to solve the problem I kept encountering: creators with great ideas but no coding skills. Traditional no-code tools are too complex. AI changes everything.</p>
        
        <p>Our beta cohort of 200 users has already generated over 3,000 apps. Here's what makes VibeCode different:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Natural language prompting - describe your app in plain English</li>
            <li>Real native apps - ships to App Store and Google Play, not web wrappers</li>
            <li>Live preview - see changes instantly as you iterate with AI</li>
            <li>One-click deployment - no certificates, provisioning, or app store complexity</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I've live-streamed building clones of $80M apps in 60 minutes and created everything from social networks to productivity tools without writing a single line of code.</p>
        
        <p>The goal isn't to replace developers - it's to give creators superpowers. When you can build exactly what you imagine, you unlock entirely new categories of products.</p>

        <h1>Riley Brown</h1>
        <p>AI educator and co-founder of VibeCode, teaching the world to build apps without code through AI.</p>
        
        <p>I help creators and entrepreneurs build fully functional apps using natural language instead of traditional programming. My approach, called "vibe coding," has helped over 1 million people discover the power of AI-assisted development.</p>
        
        <p>With <a href="vibecode.html" class="link">VibeCode</a>, we've enabled thousands of non-developers to ship real apps to the App Store. My <a href="content.html" class="link">content</a> reaches millions across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube where I share live demos and tutorials.</p>
        
        <p>I also host <a href="podcast.html" class="link">A New Vibe</a>, a weekly podcast exploring the future of AI-powered creation, and have built several successful apps including <a href="apps.html" class="link">YapThread</a>, a transcription app earning $12K/month.</p>
        
        <p>Based on the belief that early, personalized "aha" moments unlock deeper technical learning, I'm focused on making advanced app-building skills accessible to everyone.</p>

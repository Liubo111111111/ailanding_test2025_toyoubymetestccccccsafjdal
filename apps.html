        <h1>Apps & Products</h1>
        <p>Real applications I've built entirely with AI assistance. No traditional coding required.</p>
        
        <h2>YapThread</h2>
        <p>A transcription app that converts voice memos into organized, searchable threads. Built using Claude and ChatGPT, currently earning <strong>$12,000/month</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>What started as a personal tool to transcribe my own voice notes became a product used by thousands of creators, journalists, and professionals who need to quickly capture and organize their thoughts.</p>
        
        <h2>VibeCode</h2>
        <p>The mobile app builder I co-founded. While not built <em>with</em> AI, it's the platform that <em>enables</em> AI app creation for thousands of others.</p>
        
        <h2>Clone Challenges</h2>
        <p>I've live-streamed building functional clones of major applications:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Clubhouse clone - 60 minutes, fully functional audio rooms</li>
            <li>Notion clone - 4.5 hours, real-time collaborative documents</li>
            <li>Twitter clone - 90 minutes, posting, feeds, and profiles</li>
            <li>TikTok clone - 2 hours, video upload, feed, and interactions</li>
            <li>Uber clone - 3 hours, maps, ride requests, and payments</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>Each app follows the same workflow: start with a clear prompt, iterate with AI, test on device, refine based on user feedback. The key is treating AI as a collaborative partner rather than just a code generator.</p>
        
        <p>These aren't just demos - they're real apps that people use daily. The transcription app alone processes thousands of hours of audio every month.</p>
        
        <p>The lesson: when you remove the barrier of traditional programming, creators can focus on solving real problems instead of wrestling with technical implementation.</p>
